## Assets

To work on assets, navigate to the theme directory and run one of the following commands:

### Watch (development)
Continuously rebuild assets while you work:

```bash
cd wordpress/wp-content/themes/fromscratch

npm run watch
```

### Build (production)

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
cd wordpress/wp-content/themes/fromscratch

npm run build
```
